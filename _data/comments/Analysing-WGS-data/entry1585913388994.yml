message: "First of all I want to say fantastic blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask \r\nif you don't mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind prior to writing.\r\nI've had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing however it just seems like the first \r\n10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying to figure \r\nout how to begin. Any recommendations or tips?\r\nMany thanks!"
