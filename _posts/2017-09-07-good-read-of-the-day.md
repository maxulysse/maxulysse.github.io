Interesting read of the day by the excellent Carl Zimmer on medium: <a href="https://medium.com/@carlzimmer/lets-not-lose-our-minds-c5dcac29e97f" target="_blank">Let’s Not Lose Our Minds</a>.

He makes a beautiful parallel between Lysenko and his view controlling the research in genetics during the USSR old days and current situation in the USA with climate change.

A little long, but it's definitely worth reading.
